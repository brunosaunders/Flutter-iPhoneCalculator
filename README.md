# Flutter-iPhoneCalculator
This calculator app design was inspired on the calculator of iOS devices and it was made with Flutter.

# Objective
This app is my first application done and it is a good way to learn Flutter and Dart by doing. I've done this as proposed on the [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Calculator-App.md) repository.
